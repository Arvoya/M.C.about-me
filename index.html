      Hi! I'm Mayra. I am a content editor with academic foundations in social psychology and research in education. I consider myself a lifelong learner and currently I'm pursuing my goal of becoming a software developer. My current learning path is focused on building foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p><br />
    
      <p>
      I have experience working with SQL and R programming. I find data analytics, data visualization, and machine learning as fascinating areas of study and work.</p><br />
        
      <p>
      I'm fluent in English and Spanish, and I also have work experience in localization and translation.</p>
