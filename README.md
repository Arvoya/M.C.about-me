## “About Me” project

<!-->
I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app
-->

I built an “About Me” webpage that quizzes the user on fun facts and gives the user some basic information about who I am.
